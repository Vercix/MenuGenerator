## About

This is a restaurant menu generation app built with next.js. 
A quick prototype I build to try out `jsPDF` and `html2canvas`


## Usage

Run the following command to start the develpment server:

```
npm run dev
```

Or for the production server:

```
npm run build
npm run start
```

## Using the app

It is rather bare bones. But Items can be added and removed. And a page header can be set.
A pdf of the menu page can be generated by pressing the `Generate PDF` button.

## Demo
